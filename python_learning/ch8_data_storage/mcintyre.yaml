      Politeness, preseverence and pluck,

  - title : 'Canadian Charms'
    text: |
      Here industry is not in vain,
      For we have bounteous crops of grain,
      And you behold on every field
      Of gress and roots abundant yield,
      But after all the greatest charm 
      Is the sung home upon th farm,
      And stone walls now keep cattle warm.
